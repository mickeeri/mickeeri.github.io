This is a remake of my final school project. It consists of a Ruby on Rails API and a client side
application developed with React, Redux, React Router, normalizr, and React Bootstrap.

The application is aimed at small lawfirms that needs an easy way to handle clients and cases.
They will also be able to log work and generate reports.

The application is published [here](https://mickeeri.github.io/new-lawfirm-client). Under development!
