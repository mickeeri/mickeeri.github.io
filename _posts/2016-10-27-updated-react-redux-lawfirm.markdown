I have been working with remaking a school project Ruby on Rails application. It
has now been broken up into an API developed with Ruby on Rails 5 and a SPA developed
with React and Redux.

The project is under development. Please have a look at the code on [Github](https://github.com/mickeeri/new-lawfirm-client).
