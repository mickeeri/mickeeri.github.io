I have been working with remaking a school project Ruby on Rails application. It
has now been broken up into an [API](https://github.com/mickeeri/lawfirm-api) developed with Ruby on Rails 5 and a SPA developed
with React and Redux. I'm also using things like react-router, normalizr and react-bootstrap.

Is aimed at small lawfirms that want's an easy way to handle clients, legal cases and counterparts.

The project is under development. Read more and look at the code on Github
